# Business-Insights-360-for-AtliQ

Welcome to my dashboard on Business Insights 360 for AtliQ hardware company, a multinational hardware company.


## Problem statement

AtliQ Hardware is a consumer goods electronics company having operations in various countries. Their business is growing rapidly and they still rely on excel files for data analytics. Excel files are hard to consume and not effective in generating insights. Also due to the lack of effective analytics the company faced a major loss in Latin America. The project manager sought a dashboard with thorough analysis and data driven insights for Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, and Executive departments.

## Solution

My dashboard contains five different views for the five departments.
